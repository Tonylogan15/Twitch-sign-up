AND101 Project 3 - AnimalApps

Submitted by: Antonio Logan

Time spent: 4 hours spent in total

Summary

Animal Twitch Signup is an Android app that recreates a Twitch-style signup modal — but with an animal-themed twist. The app displays a full layout card with an animal logo, text fields, and styled UI elements modeled after the original Twitch signup pop-up. This project focused on practicing ConstraintLayout, ImageViews, TextViews, and precise UI duplication.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: 🐾🎨📱

Application Features

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

 Pick an app screenshot to duplicate

Be sure to add the screenshot to "Chosen Screenshot" below.

 Create a runnable app that displays an Animal Version of your chosen screenshot

 Layout uses one (1) or more ConstraintLayout

 Layout uses one (1) or more ImageView

 Layout uses three (3) or more TextViews

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

 Create a custom-shape Button using Shape Drawables

 Customize the text fonts by creating new Font Resources

 Add Tooltips to your Views

 Create a second layout for an original app idea

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

 (Optional) Added improved spacing, styling, and card-like shadows to match the Twitch UI more closely.

(Not included for this submission — no stretch layout created.)

Notes

This project helped me practice:

Rebuilding real-world UI from scratch

Using ConstraintLayout chains & constraints for precise alignment

Correctly sizing cards, paddings, and margins

Matching the look and feel of an existing screenshot

I learned how small spacing differences greatly affect how authentic a duplicated UI looks.
